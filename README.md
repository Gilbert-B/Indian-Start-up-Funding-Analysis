# Indian-Start-up-Funding-Analysis
This repositiory seeks to document the process I undertook to analyze fundings received by Indian Start-ups from 2018 to 2021.

The project aims to draw insights on funding received by Indian startups and obtain a descriptive overview and a relationship pattern of funding and growth of newly launched startups.


# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of analysing data using visual techniques to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions. 

## Introduction

This article documents the process I undertook to analyse funding received by Indian Start-ups from 2018 to 2021. We will look at how Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the data set using the Python programming language. External Python packages like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlip etc was used to conduct univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, correlation analysis and handle duplicate and missing data.

The project aims to draw insights on funding received by Indian start-ups and obtain a descriptive overview and a relationship pattern of funding and growth of newly launched start-ups.
